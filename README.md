Hi Students of FSD AUT 2025! Weekly updates on both Java and Python source code for lectures and labs will be shared here.

For Java code, please compile the program in the directory that directly contains the source files. For example, to compile the `Shapes.java` program, navigate to the `week8/lecture_java/` directory before running the compilation command.
